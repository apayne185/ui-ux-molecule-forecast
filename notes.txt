Time Series Data:

The data appears to have temporal components (i.e., year and month columns), making it well-suited for time series forecasting, especially if you're looking to predict future values like Value or Packs based on past trends.
Numerical Features:

Value and Packs: These seem to be key target variables for forecasting. Forecasting Value would involve understanding patterns of trade volume and how they relate to product activity.
Numerical Variables like Packs can be influenced by multiple factors, including seasonal demand, molecule/brand popularity, and market dynamics.
Categorical Features:

MoleculeName, TradeName, ProductName, and SKU: These can be important features, indicating product-specific behavior. You might need to encode them (e.g., via one-hot encoding or label encoding) to feed them into machine learning models.
Complex Interactions:

Given that you have several products (SKU) with varying packs and values, there might be complex interactions between MoleculeName, TradeName, and ProductName, which could impact Value and Packs.
Seasonal trends might also play a role, as some products may have higher sales in particular months or years.
Recommended Dataset for Forecasting
The forecasting targets are likely the Value and Packs columns. To model this data, you would need to focus on the following:

Feature Engineering:

Use the temporal information (year, month) to extract additional features such as month-of-year, quarter, or lag features to capture seasonality and trends.
Encoding categorical features like MoleculeName, TradeName, and ProductName will be necessary.
Time Series Aggregation:

Aggregate the data monthly or quarterly to capture larger trends rather than focusing on individual records (depending on what you want to predict).
Target Columns:

Focus on forecasting Value and/or Packs for each unique combination of MoleculeName, TradeName, and SKU over time.
Possible Forecasting Targets:

Predict the Value and Packs based on historical values, seasonality, and interactions between the other features.
Suggested Models
XGBoost / LightGBM:
Both are excellent gradient boosting frameworks and can handle the complex interactions between features like MoleculeName, TradeName, and ProductName, especially when dealing with high-cardinality categorical variables.
You can treat the task as a regression problem (predicting continuous Value or Packs) or as a multi-class classification if you aim to predict product sales for specific categories.
Random Forest:
Another strong model for capturing feature interactions. It’s robust to overfitting and can also handle categorical features.
Neural Networks (e.g., LSTM):
If you're dealing with a time-series nature (forecasting over time), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are effective for sequential data where patterns over time influence the future values.
Neural Networks can capture complex relationships better, but they may require more data and tuning.
Data Preprocessing Steps:
Lag Features: Create lag variables (e.g., value or packs in the previous month) to capture temporal relationships.
Time-based Decomposition: Use seasonality (monthly, quarterly) or holidays (if available) to improve model performance.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Apply one-hot encoding or target encoding for categorical variables (like MoleculeName and TradeName).
Final Dataset Design for Forecasting:
Target: Value or Packs
Features:
year, month (can be used to create new time-based features like seasonal dummy variables)
Encoded MoleculeName, TradeName, and ProductName
Lag features: Previous month's value or pack count
Rolling averages: Calculate rolling averages (e.g., average over 3 or 6 months) for Packs or Value to smooth out noise
Month of Year: Encode the month to capture seasonality (e.g., 1 for January, 2 for February, etc.)



✅ Check Residuals (Errors)

Plot y_test - y_pred to see if there are patterns in the errors (seasonality, trends).
If errors are not randomly distributed, the model might be missing key time-dependent structures.
✅ Feature Importance Analysis

Extract XGBoost’s feature importances to see which ones contribute most to predictions.
If some features are unimportant, removing them can reduce noise and improve accuracy.
✅ Try Time-Series-Specific Models (SARIMA, Prophet)

XGBoost is not inherently built for time series, so trying SARIMA or Prophet may provide better trend and seasonality modeling.
✅ Hybrid Modeling Approach

Combine XGBoost with ARIMA/SARIMA (e.g., using XGBoost for residuals of a time-series model).
This can improve forecasting stability.
