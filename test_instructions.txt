Task:												
"Using the provided data set, create a forecast using Python and place the results in the highlighted cells within the range of G4261:H5599 (please change only cells marked with yellow to ensure we can check your forecast).
Create a 5-slide presentation detailing your approach to solving the problem.
Share the presentation and the workbook (or the code that contains your solution)."												
												
												
												
												
Success criteria:												
1. Accuracy of the forecast.												
2. Ability to visualize data (using Python or any other tool you prefer: Excel, Power BI, Qlikâ€¦etc).												
3. Ability to explain the logic of your solution.												
												
Limitations: using or referencing any external dataset puts candidates in unequal conditions; it is not allowed and may lead to lower scores for the task.												
The use of LLMs is allowed strictly for demonstrating your Python skills - such as integrating LLMs within your code, but not for completing the task itself.												
												
*please note that it's modified data set based on the real data
